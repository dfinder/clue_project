#This UI should consist of a row for each card.
#Each row should start with a name for the card, organized by card type.
#Each row should have a knowledge box, indicating something that you know, and it should be colored by who gave it to you.
#Side note, considering that there is a 'white' peace, what should the default button color be? Some metallic?
#If you make an accusation, and it's wrong, it should color the knowledge boxes black.
#These should be clickable, and highlighted when making an accusation/guess/guess response.
#Your initial cards should color your knowledge box with your color.
#Your guesses should color the knowledge boxes of the revealed cards automatically.
#Each row should also have a box for indicating if you guessed it, what times you've guessed it, and if it's a card that you have.
#Beyond that, there should be an additional column per active player that you can click to put some mark
#Maybe indicate automatically if someone else made a guess in that combination?
