#This UI has two purposes: 
#1. Allow everyone to select/unselect a piece
#2. Allow the host to press a button moving us to the main frontend when everyone has selected a piece, and we have at least 3 players.
#So we need a button for each piece, that should indicate if someone else has selected the piece already.
